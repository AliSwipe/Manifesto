  </div>

  <div class="manifesto_paragraph">
    <p class="paragraphs">Liebe is perhaps the most narcissistic, sociopathic, arrogant, unpleasant, and obnoxious person I have ever dealt with in my life. Every waking moment I have spent with him has been absolute torture, a punishment that I would never put upon any other person on the planet. However, I have endured these past 8 months, all with the singular goal to release this document and permanently bring an end to him.
   </p>
    <p class="paragraphs">  He has consistently harassed, manipulated, and coerced me and others in the community for his own desires across his multiple alts. Around the time that Najunald was getting pushback from DGGers for saying “n*gga” too much, Liebe told me in VC that Najunald was the “token n*gger in DGG.” I was shocked when I realized he was unironically being racist in front of me in private. Also, he would most likely be too much of a pussy to say it in public.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraphs"> Not only that, Liebe has shown extraordinarily strange behavior such as when he <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/1000927595078094988/unknown.png" target="_blank"> claimed to be a black transwoman</a> in an attempt to seduce known DGG chaser and lover of girlcock Tuck_Fwitch. It's most likely that this would have led to Fwitch flirting with Liebe, where Liebe would then save these DMs to have compromising blackmail on Fwitch. Not too surprisingly, Fwitch did end up DMing Liebe a little bit, but Liebe must have thrown away his fake identity because it was too obvious and risky considering the fact that Fwitch could easily reach out to me or PastelDallas about it and realize that Liebe was lying. </p>


    <p class="paragraphs">All of this I have witnessed and unfortunately stood as a bystander for the sake that he will no longer be able to enact his twisted games upon others. These past 8 months have provided far more than enough evidence and thus, it is finally time for the killshot. </p>

    <h1 class="subHeadings">The Unironic Trans Question
</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="manifesto_paragraph">
    <p class=paragraphs> On the night of July 7th, Stardog messaged me about the document that I was working on, which I had hinted at earlier that day. He told me that he was in the process of talking to someone <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/998146928577617951/unknown.png" target="_blank"> who was supposedly “working” for me.</a> Confused, I asked him who he was talking about because I had never asked anyone except for Stardog to “investigate” for me. The person was Liebe, who claimed that I had sent him to ask around for me, something which I had never done. <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/998147012946042900/unknown.png" target="_blank"> Stardog informed me that he was asking questions about trans chatters,</a> looking for any information on them. I told Stardog to keep an eye on him for me and to send me all logs of what was happening. </p>

    <p class=paragraphs>The next time he sent me logs was on July 9th, at which point <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/998148203503427585/unknown.png" target="_blank"> Stardog pressed Liebe on why he was asking the questions.</a> This is when Liebe told Stardog to ask me, still holding on to his claim that I had sent him to research for me. Little did he know that Stardog was already in contact with me. <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/998148601979084801/unknown.png" target="_blank">The next morning, Stardog messaged me that Liebe had redacted all of their DMs</a>, probably realizing he got caught. He had also blocked Stardog. </p>

    <p class=paragraphs> At this point there was a week-long break of no information regarding Liebe coming from Stardog. On the night of July 15th, Liebe was brought up during a conversation and <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/998149475912658994/unknown.png?width=820&height=630" target="_blank"> we wondered who else that Liebe may have asked questions to</a>. A possible theory that Stardog came up with is the idea that Liebe may have been writing <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/998149770340220988/unknown.png" target="_blank">a trans chatter manifesto using the information</a> that he has been collecting. Shortly afterwards, Stardog reached out to <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/998149982198706267/unknown.png" target="_blank"> several of his friends</a> to figure out who Liebe has been in contact with recently, sending each of them <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/998144540936511578/unknown.png" target="_blank"> this screenshot</a>. The last I heard, Stardog <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/998150357194653706/unknown.png?width=495&height=630" target="_blank"> didn’t get any results</a> from the people he had talked to. I went to bed and in the morning, <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/998150734988197958/unknown.png" target="_blank"> I woke up to a permaban from RTBA, claiming that I was stalking chatters</a>. </p>

    <p class=paragraphs> I’m not sure what RTBA was told, but I think it's clear now that I wasn’t the one doing any doxxing. My guess is that RTBA saw the screenshot that Stardog was sending around, without knowing about the context that Stardog included of Liebe lying about being commanded by me. </p>

    <p class=paragraphs> It’s clear that Liebe seems to have some obsession with transwomen. The first indicator other than the above stalking is the fact that he used to watch PastelDallas’ stream, which was most likely solely due to the fact that she is trans. I refuse to believe he had any other reason to first open her stream and become a consistent viewer of hers than this. He would constantly bully her for her gender and make transphobic jokes, with the intention to harm her. Liebe also <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/852630933554331739/996931690813464596/unknown.png" target="_blank"> called a DGGer a "f*g"</a>, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/2J0lMWq" target="_blank"> for which he got a week ban for</a> and later called her the most pathetic, soylord tr*nny to ever grace DGG. Liebe got triggered enough by this interaction to where <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/852630933554331739/996935204092518512/unknown.png" target="_blank"> he considered nuking his account by dropping n words everywhere</a>. He has also told me of many interactions he had on Twitter, which again many were with transwomen, such as the time when he laughed at a <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997403173113311243/unknown.png" target="_blank"> twitter post</a> and was then <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/996968743315976212/unknown.png?width=478&height=630" target="_blank"> privately dmed by a transwoman</a> afterwards. There was another time where he learned that one of his <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997404813245546616/unknown.png?width=868&height=630" target="_blank"> old friends on one of his previous accounts from years ago recently transitioned</a>. He rejoined this community under a secret identity and proceeded to <a href="https://imgur.com/a/RFjpovf" target="_blank"> tell them to rope it</a>. The server’s mods <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/852630933554331739/996564838409060363/unknown.png" target="_blank"> banned him a few days after</a>. Liebe never even told her his real identity, she will never know what happened to her former friend and he actively contributed to harassing her. He also was planning on writing a DIY HRT manifesto after engaging in a debate with Striker and Jazzly, however he never ended up writing it. Even he knows of the fact that he disproportionately bullies transwomen, shown by <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Q35fiqt" target="_blank"> these jokes</a>. </p>

    <p class="paragraphs2">The Disappearance Of</p>
    <p class=paragraphs> My first interactions with NeoLiebe when I met him around February 2021 in PastelDallas’ Twitch chat were all pretty positive. He seemed like a typical DGGer, an edgy memer who just really doesn’t give a fuck. He didn’t have any weird takes or behaviors, so he never caught my eye, but more importantly I also didn’t catch his eye. Me and Pastel would both agree that the three of us became pretty good friends. However, it is important to note that his <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997321757776171038/unknown.png" target="_blank"> sense of humor was very aggressive</a>. It mostly consisted of him <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997321875749343362/unknown.png" target="_blank"> straight up bullying Pastel</a> as <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997322054858723378/unknown.png" target="_blank"> often as he could</a>. Other than that, everything was fine during these first two months, until April 14th, 2021. </p>
<div class="top2">
  <img class="log_screenshots" src="media/unnamed.png" alt="logs">
  <p class="paragraphs3">The “But almost unironically this time” is a reference to when Liebe said that Adeptthebest had a ‘derpstiny’ face in DGG. This resulted in him getting <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997314025530597446/unknown.png" target="_blank">pushback</a> for ableism and misogyny from both DGG and discord, concluding in him leaving the depicted discord server for a week.</p>
</div>
    <p class=paragraphs> Everything was gone. The only thing that remained were his OverRustle logs, as Redact.dev didn’t exist yet at that time. I saved these logs and scoured them to find any hints for his current location. I even cross referenced his logs with other chatters to see if there was any possibility of others knowing, but everything came up empty. My only conclusion was <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997301197650272346/unknown.png" target="_blank"> suicide</a>. </p>
    <p class="paragraphs2">God Knows...</p>
    <p class=paragraphs> 7 months after Liebe’s disappearance, on November 21st I noticed a chatter by the name of Arbitrage. They were asking PastelDallas to stream, which as her head mod is something that I would definitely take note of, especially since it was a name that I didn’t recognize. </p>
    <p class=paragraphs> Pastel streamed on the 22nd and as expected, Arbitrage showed up. Not too long after the stream started, I made a comment about the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/QGZ87j2" target="_blank"> similarities between Arbitrage and Liebe in chat</a>. After this, I checked his logs in DGG and realized that the account was new. Most suspicious was the fact that he <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997333241734365204/unknown.png" target="_blank"> originally claimed to be an old viewer of the stream who had just never chatted before</a>. It was at this time that I made the connection that Arbitrage and Liebe are probably the same person. </p>
    <p class=paragraphs> One of the things that Arbitrage told me and Pastel was about his alleged “toxic and crazy” girlfriend at the time. According to him, she was massively obsessive and depressed, constantly cutting herself and <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997324220101054464/unknown.png" target="_blank"> even asking Liebe to cut her during sex</a>. He told us about how she would <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997321633968705646/unknown.png" target="_blank"> possibly kill him or herself if he threatened to break off the relationship</a>. Personally, I think it's likely that this whole story was a fraud. Either that or he was the one who was actually being abusive and manipulative. Something I noticed that is connected to his relationship with his ex is <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/996966985273450526/unknown.png" target="_blank"> this quote</a>. I truly believe that when people make oddly specific jokes like this, it is usually them projecting in reference to something that they personally experienced and I wouldn’t doubt it if this actually happened. </p>
    <p class=paragraphs> At the end of the stream, Arbitrage asked for my discord and DMed me, curious if I had <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997302941486694480/unknown.png" target="_blank"> any old VODs or clips of Pastel's stream</a> as he wanted to check up on old memes. He noticed that the clips I had saved were only up to April 14th, the same day that Liebe left. After looking through what I had sent, I repeatedly <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997303525170237450/unknown.png?width=351&height=630" target="_blank"> hinted at the fact that he was Liebe</a>, especially since he hinted at something that would have been impossible for Arbitrage to know. <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997303962011189248/unknown.png?width=216&height=630" target="_blank"> Eventually</a>, <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997304240550723644/unknown.png?width=533&height=630" target="_blank"> he confessed</a> and we talked about everything he missed during his 7 month break. I noticed that he still watched Destiny during that entire time and <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997304784019275816/unknown.png" target="_blank"> possibly knew about DGG specific chatter memes</a>, so it's still entirely possible he had used other DGG alt accounts. </p>
    <p class=paragraphs> Something to take note here is how <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/986494162750812180/995953046066569306/unknown.png?width=362&height=629" target="_blank"> nice and sentimental</a> he was during our conversation. To this day, I have never seen him act anything like this and it seemed like he actually appreciated me catching him up on the memes. I'm not sure if I will ever know whether or not his behavior here was genuine or a fake personality to make me like him more. Knowing what I know now, it's most likely that the sociopath was manipulatively going for the latter option. </p>
    <p class=paragraphs> Another thing he told me was that we would never see each other again after the next stream that Pastel did. At once, I started to save all of our logs on DGG, discord, and on Twitch. I also promised to him <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997304951816597545/unknown.png" target="_blank"> that I wouldn't let anyone know of his return</a>, including Pastel. On his last day, he <a href="https://imgur.com/a/LHhwkTa" target="_blank"> trolled DGG poker by doing a meme all in, said that RTBA was a stupid mod who should rope, and then told Bing to kill himself</a>. Next, he redacted his discord DMs and deleted all his accounts. He <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997333145349279864/unknown.png" target="_blank"> didn't say a real bye to Pastel</a> or anyone other than me. Except for the bittersweet feeling he left me, once again, everything was gone. </p>
  <p class="paragraphs2">SOS Brigade</p>
  <p class=paragraphs> On December 16th, I was randomly mentioned by a chatter named Mortuary. I thought it was weird because I hadn’t typed recently in chat so I instantly realized that it was 1000% Liebe on a new alt. I took a quick look at his logs, and surprisingly the account was made on December 5th, meaning it only took 2 weeks for Liebe to break his promise of never returning. We did a bit of catching up as he wasn’t trying to hide his identity from me and then I <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997308444233171014/unknown.png" target="_blank"> added him into the original discord server that we used to talk in</a>. However, he still wanted to lie about his identity and rejoin as Mortuary, not Liebe. </p>

  <p class=paragraphs> Although we were <a href="https://imgur.com/a/lB5kqZf" target="_blank"> forced to lie and say that Mortuary was actually wypeepo because he was an obvious alt</a>, things went decently well. Mortuary wanted to <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997307084536283156/unknown.png" target="_blank"> rejoin the server under a different name though</a>, as he didn’t want to be associated with some of the DGG logs on his Mortuary account. </p>

  <p class=paragraphs> The plan was simple. <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997307323276070932/unknown.png?width=829&height=630" target="_blank"> I told him we would make a new account, cause some fake drama between me and him in DGG using my schizoposting reputation, and then lead that into me inviting him into the server as a fake apology to try and get to know him better</a>. This DGG account was named Nichi. After my interactions with him in DGG, some people started to claim that Nichi and I were actually the same person, which as you can see is not true, no matter how much people like Calcifer64 and martiano like to claim so (more info on this in my first manifesto). I <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997309924453404732/unknown.png" target="_blank"> invited Nichi to the server</a> on his discord account. His first message was “Wow, there are a lot of n word logs in this server”, <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997309662053531739/unknown.png" target="_blank"> resulting in an instant kick</a>, throwing away all the progress we made the previous 2 hours. </p>


  <p class=paragraphs> On December 19th, me and Mortuary joined a VC because he was bored. I shared my screen and showed him some memes from the discord server, including some from a private channel. <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997311343382245446/unknown.png" target="_blank"> Someone noticed I was showing him logs from this private channel</a>, resulting in his ban and my removal from the private channel. </p>
  </div>

   <div class='manifesto_heading'>
        <h1 class="subHeadings">Endless Eight</h1>
    </div>

 <div class="manifesto_paragraph"> 
<p class=paragraphs> Following the ban of the Mortuary account, Liebe immediately decided to come back <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997314663081582642/unknown.png?width=415&height=630" target="_blank"> under his original name</a>: the beginning of our last 8 months. Liebe sent a friend request to one of the mods and he was returned with a server invite. Pastel, Liebe, and I all had a <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/827168360197521461/922065233361641492/unknown.png" target="_blank"> nice reunion in voice</a>, but Liebe continued to hide information about his original disappearance and his alt accounts. I would say at this time is when Liebe started to show his true colors, at least to me. I gained a lot of his trust by lying to my own friends for him multiple times. He also established to me that he would delete everything one final time and that he actually would never come back again. At this point, we started a series of adventures that would help me understand Liebe. </p>

<p class=paragraphs> On Christmas night, me and Liebe were strolling through some twitch streams. We were <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997316354875080734/unknown.png?width=463&height=630" target="_blank"> browsing for any low viewer streams</a>, anyone that we could easily talk and have an interesting conversation with. Throughout this time, Liebe was constantly berating them, bullying them for having no life, saying that they were depressed, or just straight up being misogynistic and racist. He was mostly looking for female streamers in particular, no doubt to anonymously let out his sexism. He repeatedly claimed that he would <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997316606931779654/unknown.png?width=1109&height=630" target="_blank"> be a good VTuber, so he could unironically steal money</a> from depressed people while pretending to show off his virtual tits. He even <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997316042554622025/unknown.png" target="_blank"> laughed at a kid who supposedly got groomed over discord</a>. </p>

<p class=paragraphs> Liebe also once reached out to me telling me he had some content we could do together. We hopped on voice and he asked me if I had an alt account. I reluctantly told him yes, as I knew that this was going to be something pretty degenerate. The plan he had was that we would go onto /soc/, a board dedicated for meetups, and go to a discord friend making thread. Our goal was just to find interesting people to talk to, which for Liebe means the most schizophrenic people on the planet. While Liebe tried to do psychoanalysis on his targets, I actually talked and made friends with some cool people. The normal people that Liebe found, he would talk to for a few days and then suddenly block and ghost when he felt bored of them. Liebe said to me that he is “to 4channers what pedophiles are to children”. </p>

<p class=paragraphs2> Jabberwocky </p>

<p class=paragraphs> Liebe’s disappearance left a permanent mark on his friendship with Pastel. She could no longer trust Liebe, as he could leave at any time. Not only that, but <a href="https://imgur.com/a/4fBCVS5" target="_blank"> she felt betrayed because he didn’t show any empathy when he left without saying anything</a>. Returning to his roots, Liebe got back to using his signature humor, which always bordered on the line between joking and harassing, and he passed the line of harassment plenty. Along with the constant meme of calling Liebe a sociopath coming from me and Pastel, <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997276280875667496/unknown.png?width=929&height=630" target="_blank"> he got the impression that we couldn’t ever fully trust him</a>, so he started to give up on developing his relationships with us. </p>

<p class=paragraphs> Liebe went so far as to go and <a href="https://imgur.com/a/nJOeCoB" target="_blank"> test out some of his beliefs, leaving a group chat that Pastel made with all three of us</a>. Obviously, this <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997279040215982100/unknown.png?width=388&height=630" target="_blank"> did upset her</a>. Liebe said that it would be for the best <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/816103363702816779/930375427996934174/unknown.png" target="_blank"> if they stopped talking</a>. It was unfair for Liebe to be straight up abusing her like this when Pastel truly did believe him to be a friend and was now <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997279432421167164/unknown.png" target="_blank"> scared that he would permanently leave again</a>. Not only that, it was a social experiment, so he was quite literally playing with her emotions. </p>

<p class=paragraphs> Liebe once took a two week break from discord during the beginning of February 2022. When he came back, I asked him for his reasoning. Here, he told me that one of the reasons why he breaks contact with others is because of the <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997262002672123957/unknown.png?width=1143&height=630" target="_blank"> commitment it requires</a> to stay in contact and engage. </p>

<p class=paragraphs> On February 22nd, Liebe asked me randomly how my friendship with Pastel was doing. I answered and told him <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997264233395929088/unknown.png?width=1415&height=629" target="_blank"> why I think I’m still friends with either of them</a>. We then discussed whether or not Liebe should continue being friends with Pastel and we both agreed that it <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997265104544481340/unknown.png?width=1440&height=390" target="_blank"> would be better if he stayed away from her</a>, due to the fact that it will be inevitable for Liebe to leave anyways. At the end of this conversation, Liebe <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997266596512931870/unknown.png?width=1440&height=83" target="_blank"> asked me to leak everything</a> about our history together to Pastel, at which point <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997265512767701072/unknown.png" target="_blank"> I revealed that I already had</a> on January 11th. He never ended up telling Pastel himself. Yellow was a codeword for his signature disappearances, so he was planning on leaving once again that Friday night, although he never ended up going through with it. </p>

<p class=paragraphs> The biggest argument between Liebe and Pastel was on April 23rd. Liebe opened her stream for the first time in months and <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/967673913947590656/unknown.png" target="_blank"> baited her about a take she gave on discord a few hours earlier</a>. Pastel was in the middle of a Melee stream, which means <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/922058442301136927/967640271108046888/unknown.png" target="_blank"> she was ultra tilted</a>. This debate ended up with <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997281080283500614/unknown.png?width=311&height=630" target="_blank"> Liebe getting permabanned from her chat and kicked out of her discord server</a>. I entered chat and <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/967661663929131038/unknown.png?width=290&height=630" target="_blank"> I started to defend Liebe</a>, saying it wasn’t completely justified to ban him. In the end, <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997281717758992445/unknown.png?width=731&height=630" target="_blank"> Pastel decided not to completely burn bridges with Liebe</a>, although this was obviously the end of their friendship as they hadn’t really talked ever since then. </p>

        <h1 class="subHeadings">Isekai of his Own Invention</h1>
    </div>

 <div class="manifesto_paragraph"> 
  <p class=paragraphs> One very interesting aspect is the fact that Liebe’s favorite anime is <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/849/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu" target="_blank"> Haruhi</a>. As I was interested in what type of anime a sociopath likes and in an effort to make me more likable, I decided to watch the entirety of Haruhi. For those who don’t know, Haruhi is an anime about a high school girl who is essentially God and she subconsciously creates the universe around herself to fulfill her own perfect life, full of supernatural phenomena such as aliens and time travelers. Watching this anime incredibly helped me understand the way that Liebe views the online world, and most likely the real world as well. Liebe has always been very detached from making personal and emotional connections, shown by the fact that he literally left me and Pastel without saying anything and the fact that he literally <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997319818376126546/unknown.png" target="_blank"> didn’t care about his own grandmother dying</a>. I think the fact that Liebe likes this show so much means that he is self inserting. Not only does the main character act somewhat similarly to Liebe, I believe the whole Haruhi being a god is a <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997318586739720252/unknown.png?width=904&height=630" target="_blank"> major indicator to himself inserting within the story</a>. There is nothing that Liebe wishes more than to live a life like Haruhi, going on adventures looking into the supernatural and being the most important person on the planet. This is a <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997318980102529116/unknown.png?width=976&height=630" target="_blank"> “joke” I made which I am pretty sure is pretty accurate to his dream life</a>. It’s why he does psyops, plays with people's perspectives, obsesses over the idea of “subversion on a mass scale”, constantly calls himself a God, and creates fake personalities. He is the perfect example of a person going through Eighth Grade Syndrome. It is truly disturbing how pathetic Liebe is and his need to be an important person, when we all know that he is nothing but a poor sociopath. Unfortunately, there are much darker things that he also self inserts into… </p>


  <p class=paragraphs2> The Savior TW: Rape, Bestiality</p>

  <p class=paragraphs> Liebe suggested to me that we should read a visual novel together titled SubaHibi on April 18th, a game that would take us over 60 hours to complete. I was designated as the reader for the novel - meaning I would read every line of text - because it was something I had done before for different story driven games and visual novels we had completed together. From what he told me, it was a romantic novel about high schoolers, which he recommended for us because some “crazy shit” happens. It was clear he knew something I didn’t. </p>

  <p class=paragraphs> It wasn’t until the second chapter where I realized that something was wrong. The main character was all of a sudden forced into a gay rape scene, where two high school bullies forced him into cross dressing and giving them both blowjobs. This scene was extremely uncomfortable to deal with, especially since I was forced to read out the dialogue and he didn’t even tell me of this type of content to be in the novel. I painfully read through it though and was extremely relieved once the scene was over. I kept reading as I mistakenly figured that this scene would be unique, but there was much more to come. As we read through it, the story included numerous amounts of rape scenes, each one extending for at least 30 minutes at a time. Women and men getting raped, gangbanged, pissed on, drugged, cut into pieces, and forced into suicide. There was even a scene where a group of high schoolers forced a dog onto one of their classmates and a scene where the main character fucks a desk, which is what Liebe’s <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/852630933554331739/1000991644134412399/unknown.png" target="_blank"> current discord pfp</a> depicts. Liebe would laugh at these scenes and the victims of the rapes, insulting them for allowing themselves to be put into those positions. I could only imagine what he was doing on the other side of the voice call as he quietly sat, watching the naked high schoolers get penetrated. He would shake with excitement everyday that we would read and continue to make references to the novel even after we finished it. Liebe would even sympathize with the main character Takuji, who would turn from an innocent kid into a cult leader that murdered other students and teachers in the high school where the game took place. He said he truly felt like Takuji’s friend as Takuji came up with sinister plans to spread the influence of the cult. This also ties in with the Haruhi self inserts, as one of the main plot points of SubaHibi is that Takuji is also subconsciously creating the reality around him. It’s no wonder that Liebe would like Takuji and Haruhi, as both of them are their own respective Gods. Liebe strives to be like them, attempting to form an Isekai of His Own Invention in his own reality. The creepiest part was when the final credits of the game finished, he told me how much he loved reading it with me and how he enjoyed how my voice really fit all the different characters as they went through their trials and tribulations… </p>

   <div class='manifesto_heading'>
        <h1 class="subHeadings">The Melancholy Of</h1>
    </div>

<div class="manifesto_paragraph"> 
  <p class=paragraphs> Liebe is the epitome of narcissism. When someone calls themselves a God, they’re proud of themselves, but when you’re constantly saying it, even when it’s not in reference to anything, it comes to a point where you’re just being egotistical and arrogant. Anytime we were in VC, there was probably an 80% chance that during any moment of silence he would just scream out about being a god. Not only that, he would blasphemously call himself a godkin with angel’s blood coursing in his veins, a reference to an old schizo bit I used to do with a chatter named Aljo. </p>

  <p class=paragraphs> One reason why Liebe likes to redact everything about himself during one of his disappearances is the idea that it’s easier to <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997297460995178587/unknown.png" target="_blank"> forget about people if you don't have anything to look back on</a>. He truly believes that people will remember him for years to come, even if they interacted with him for a few weeks. Yet, even though he recognizes that he does have an effect on other people, he still left me and Pastel with zero consideration of our friendship. </p>

  <p class=paragraphs> Another sociopathic behavior that Liebe exhibited was his obsession on “information collecting”, which is literally a nice way of saying blackmail. He has told me multiple times that he <a href="https://imgur.com/a/llgREC9" target="_blank"> collects information on specific people to catalog information in hopes of using it on them. What he does is create a private discord server, and throws in any and all information that catches his eye</a>. This can go as little as specific screenshots of jokes or even as far as entire DMs saved. He would also constantly ask me questions about people who I recently talked to. For example, anytime he would see a new chatter he didn’t recognize, especially if they were in PastelDallas’ Twitch chat, he would ask me about them. Here, I learn about <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997317268864241746/unknown.png" target="_blank"> a list he was making on CIS women in DGG</a>. I know he’s not joking because he searched up his list one time in VC with me to double check if I told him whether Emery was CIS or not. </p>

  <p class=paragraphs> An example of his dark, schizophrenic ramblings is when he made a “joke” about hypothetically entering a discord community or something similar focused around epileptics and then posting triggering gifs in an attempt to give everyone seizures. If gifs are paused then he would spam post multiple rainbow images that are each slightly different to simulate a moving gif. He laughed at the idea that they all would be dying together because of his gifs and said something along the lines of “retarded epileptics, just imagine all of them sitting in their chairs seizing all at once.” </p>

  <p class=paragraphs> An interesting part of Liebe’s mind is his liking of violence and trauma. His favorite trope in fiction is when the main character is repeatedly put into the worst positions and punished to the most extreme extents, as shown in SubaHibi and Re:Zero. Liebe has put this into his own fictional writings, as shown in this NSFL short story titled <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ki--hFbbwmU2L7FUGCM3WGMPhDT-PSHRcmk1W3HjCdc/edit" target="_blank"> Falling Down</a>. It features disturbing content such as schizophrenic ramblings of a man who raped a woman’s eye socket, ate her shit, and cut her into pieces. Liebe even told me he censored this for me because it was way too deranged to release in its original form. </p>

  <p class="paragraphs2">Rule of Two</p>
  <p class=paragraphs> A glaring question that this manifesto has not yet truly answered is: “Why did Liebe trust me of all people? And what was his goal with talking to me?” The answer is pretty simple, out of all the different communities that Liebe has joined and left, I am possibly the only one to have ever reconnected with one of his old identities. Liebe wasn’t expecting me to interrogate his Arbitrage identity and I think he may have let his emotions get the better of him. As for his goal with me, he most likely wanted to “groom” me into being like him. I knew about his disappearing act and I didn’t show any resentment. He saw me and must have realized that I would actually listen to his ideas and beliefs, so he decided that I would be his “apprentice”. </p>
  <p class=paragraphs> This leads into the question: “Why did I entertain him?” Honestly, I’m a pretty reserved and boring person, so <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997264233395929088/unknown.png?width=1415&height=629" target="_blank"> I literally just do whatever people tell me to do</a>. I’m down to basically do anything with anyone, as long as it doesn’t cost me money / is extremely cringe. But there were multiple situations that were offensive, embarrassing, and cringe for me that he put me through, such as reading the entirety of SubaHibi. The reason why I forced myself to be in these situations was because of this document. Back in early January, around the time of the Darsh incident, I had already begun the ideas of my first manifesto. At the same time, I made the plans to create this manifesto because I knew that this would escalate. I even created a <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/852630933554331739/997298995389009950/unknown.png" target="_blank"> folder titled Liebe that eventually ended up being 7 gigabytes</a> (most of which are two twitch vods). Yes, I started the prep for this Liebe manifesto back in early January 2022. Ever since then, I’ve had this in the back of my mind, although I never would have thought that he would actually become a person worth canceling. </p>

  <p class=paragraphs> And Liebe, if you ever make it back, I’ll be sure to stop you once again. </p>
